      <h2>Brawler Game</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/737789733" id="brawlerscratch"> Brawler Game on Scratch</a></p>
      <p>The project was to make a game based on our chosen genre, and we chose a brawler game. Our main goal was to get
        the skins and fighting mechanics working so that it was a functional and fun game to play on the arcade machine.
        We did have a few challenges, such as small bugs that came up when we would add something new to the game. I
        learned a lot about coding and getting a game to have full functionality.</p>

      <h2>Drawing app project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898529023"> Drawing app</a></p>
      <p>In the drawing app, the goal was to make an application that could draw different shapes based on the desired
        amount of sides. More and more goals were added throughout the project that gave even more work, but in the end
        it added a lot more functionality and usability. I really learned how much math could be used in a simple
        program like this, a program that people might use and think how simple it is, but in reality it is a lot more
        complex than it may seem.</p>

      <h2>Personal project</h2>
      <p>I found a great interest in making a functional radio, so I bought my own radio kit off of amazon and put it
        together. The main goal was to obtain a functional radio with an alarm and could tune in to FM radio
        frequencies. I feel the main challenge was getting the battery terminals set up because they had a very hard
        time fitting into the body of the radio and getting the thin wires soldered onto the battery terminals was not
        easy. I learned a lot about how radios actually work and how they can tune into a radio frequency.</p>
