      <h2>Brawler Game</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/737789733" id="brawlerscratch"> Brawler Game on Scratch</a></p>
      <p>The project was to make a game based on our chosen genre, and we chose a brawler game. Our main goal was to get the skins and fighting mechanics working so that it was a functional and fun game to play on the arcade machine. We did have a few challenges, such as small bugs that came up when we would add something new to the game. I learned a lot about coding and getting a game to have full functionality.</p>

      <h2>Drawing app project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898529023"> Drawing app</a></p>
      <p>In the drawing app, the goal was to make an application that could draw different shapes based on the desired amount of sides. More and more goals were added throughout the project that gave even more work, but in the end it added a lot more functionality and usability. I really learned how much math could be used in a simple program like this, a program that people might use and think how simple it is, but in reality it is a lot more complex than it may seem.</p>
