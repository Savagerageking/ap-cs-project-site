      <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898529023"> Drawing app</a></h2>
      <p>In the drawing app, the goal was to make an application that could draw different shapes based on the desired
        amount of sides. More and more goals were added throughout the project that gave even more work, but in the end
        it added a lot more functionality and usability. I really learned how much math could be used in a simple
        program like this, a program that people might use and think how simple it is, but in reality it is a lot more
        complex than it may seem.</p>

        For my ap create project I decided to make a password manager that can store a users passwords but to also remove and find their passwords.
        The hardest part of this project was being able to figure out how to use the built in json package in python and finding out how to create a json file
        and store those passwords. The main method I used was converting the json file into a python dictionary, then either adding to that dictionary, deleting something
        at a specific property name, or finding something as a property name and then converts it back to the json file with the new dictionary.

        For this project we used a pi pico which is a mini computer to control a neopixel strip of light. Our goal was to create a functioning stop light
        that simulates what a stop light would do in terms of light order. We used thonny as the IDE to write our code to the pico which would set the light
        and wait 3 seconds before changing it to something else.
