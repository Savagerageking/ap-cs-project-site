      <p>This is the first part of this assigment which is to make the first version of a bridge that we tested. We had size limitations on making this bridge as it could only be a max of 400mm and we had to build it out of cardboard that was available.
        We were limited in the materials we could use to help like tape or wood support or anything much, we could use string and cardboard screws and the bridge had to be able to fit two small cars on it. The way we assembled it was by putting slots into the top and bottom,
      and putting holes that fit into those slots on the trusses. Our bridge had a weight of about 30g and supported about 6.8kg.</p>

        </div>
      <p>Overall, the bridge was very strong and the weight of it was a huge point to making it so efficient, and the design was quick and easy to assemble while being strong. The changes we need to do is making the bridge longer because it was on the very edge of the table
        and that was the first thing to fail as the ends of the bridge just bent in once we put enough weight in. We also need to possibly use double ply on the trusses for more strength and make the edge of the trusses strong by getting rid of the holes or make them thicker.

        <p>For this assignment, I had to make a train from the drawings that were provided to me. There were 9 parts that had to be built and a few of them were difficult considering
          that not all dimensions were provided so it really required me to make the sketches fully constrained. This advanced my knowledge of fusion and allowed me to make an actual project, not just a random object for practice.
          I also learned new techniques that are faster and easier when making odd shapped objects like the wheel and cow catcher.</p>
