      <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/737789733" id="brawlerscratch"> Brawler Game</a></h2>
      <p>The project was to make a game based on our chosen genre, and we chose a brawler game. Our main goal was to get
        the skins and fighting mechanics working so that it was a functional and fun game to play on the arcade machine.
        We did have a few challenges, such as small bugs that came up when we would add something new to the game. I
        learned a lot about coding and getting a game to have full functionality.</p>

      <h2>Personal project</h2>
      <p>I found a great interest in making a functional radio, so I bought my own radio kit off of amazon and put it
        together. The main goal was to obtain a functional radio with an alarm and could tune in to FM radio
        frequencies. I feel the main challenge was getting the battery terminals set up because they had a very hard
        time fitting into the body of the radio and getting the thin wires soldered onto the battery terminals was not
        easy. I learned a lot about how radios actually work and how they can tune into a radio frequency.</p>
